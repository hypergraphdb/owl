# OWL in HyperGraphDB

The Ontology Web Language (OWL) 2.0 is a semantic web standard based on Description Logics (DL). More information on the [W3C OWL 2.0 home page](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) as well as at the [OWL 2 Wikipedia topic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language).

The HGDBOWL module offers a **complete, persistent, fully transactional** implementation of the `de facto` standard [OWLAPI](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/) for working with OWL ontologies. Each ontology is naturally represented as a sub-graph within a HyperGraphDB instance, thanks to the native nested graph support.
